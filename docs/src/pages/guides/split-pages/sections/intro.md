## Introduction to split pages

This page demos the split page pattern and provides steps on how to implement it on a site.

### What is the split page pattern?

The split page pattern splits a longer page into multiple markdown files (also known as partial files) and then imports the markdown files into a single page.

This pattern is helpful for improving internal developer experience.

### Current uses cases

This split pages pattern is used by [API documentation](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/), [Studio manual reference](https://docs.mapbox.com/studio-manual/reference/), [Accounts pricing page](https://docs.mapbox.com/accounts/overview/pricing/), and [Vector Tiles Specification](https://docs.mapbox.com/vector-tiles/specification/).
